    subtitle: "A classic yacht"
    intro: "Hanna Maria is a 43' long yacht, designed with classic features above water line and with fast modern lines below. After a one year design work, she was built during a six years period in Göteborg Sweden and launched the first time 1995 and have been sailing in Scandinavian waters since then."

            - text: "Building a boat, based on my own design, had been a dream for many years and when I started the design, I did not really believe that I would complete this project. I had for many years, together with my wife and our two children, been sailing an International One Design, designed by the famous Norwegian designer Bjarne Aas. I am, by profession, a naval architect and have since 1976 been working at a model test basin, located in Gothenburg. My professional specialities are design of mathematical models for simulation of ship motions. This work, together with my interest for sailing, led me into the design of a so called VPP (Velocity Prediction Program) that is used for predicting the speed of an arbitrary sailing yacht in different wind conditions. With this program as a basis I started the design of my future 43Ҡsailing yacht. At that time, around 1987-1988, numerical design programs were not commonly used, why my design was made in the traditional way, by use of ducks and splines and on a drawing film."
            - text: "Since I always had been sailing wooden boats before, the choice of hull material was easy. It should in some way be based on wood. On the other hand I was not an experienced boat builder. In fact I had never before built a boat of my own, although I had worked quite a lot with my IOD, and successively gained a certain skill. After many discussions with friends and with my brother (who, during the same period, built a 10% larger boat, based on the same lines), I eventually choose a method based on wooden strip planking covered with GRP. My brother had some years before successfully restored an old wooden yacht by covering it with GRP."

                    - text: "It should be a long slender yacht with (in my eyes) beautiful lines and long traditional over hangs."
                    - text: "It should have good sailing properties."
                    - text: "It should be able to comfortably accommodate a crew of four."

            - text: "The first criteria above is of course very subjective, but nevertheless of great importance. In contrary to most modern Swedish yachts it should have a positive spring, and be supplied with a short distinctive cabin house, with fore end well aft of the mast. A high fractional rig is both good looking and practical, especially when choosing a self-tailing jib."

                - text: "The actual building of the boat started in the autumn of 1989. I raised a canvas tent in a small boat yard in Gothenburg. All the frames and the floors I had previously manufactured in my own small workshop at home. Both of them in laminated oak and each frame connected to its own floor. Around the keel, there is one floor on each side of respective frame, in order to ensure that the keel forces are appropriately absorbed. Thus the first task was to raise all the frames, totally 16, still applied on the moulds. The hull was built upside down in order to make it easier. All the oak tree, which I used for frames and floors, I had bought from a farmer some 200 km north of Gothenburg, about two years in advance, thus providing time for the tree to dry up properly."
                - text: "The keelson was laminated directly on the floors, using 200×10 mm oak layers, totally twelve on top of each other. Each layer was fastened to the one below, by use of both glue (aerolite) and stainless wooden screws. This work with successively laying the keelson was completed in spring 1990. It was then time to start the laying of the planking."

                - text: "I considered strip planking to be a method that could effectively be used for an amateur as I considered myself being. Combined with an outer skin of GRP it provides a hull, which I believed to be sufficiently strong. The strips were cut with one male and one female side, making it easy to mount the strips together along the hull surface. Each strip was fastened to the next one by screws at spacing of approximately 200 mm and by use of polyurethane glue. In addition each strip fastened to the frames by use of 50 mm screws."

Between the teak on top and the pine I choose to lay a 3 mm GRP layer for water protection. The teak ribs were sealed with thiodikt. All deck houses and skylights were built in mahogany."

                - text: "It took me about five to six years to learn the boat properly and to adjust all the drawbacks that I initially experienced. When having launched the boat in the summer of 1995, I found that the weight calculations had been successful. This was a one of the most difficult parts in the design. As a matter of fact it was trimming exactly on the water line as I had expected. Later, however, I discovered that the stability was less than that being predicted. One important reason for this was that the mast weighed much more than initially estimated. In my calculations, I had estimated its weight to approximately 200 kg, i. e. without any stays and fittings. It turned out to be 275 kg. For five summers we sailed with this heavy mast. Every spring and every autumn, when rigging and de-rigging, it caused a lot of effort and nervousness. Eventually I decided to make a new one. The first, original one, was made in Oregon pine, and was quite robust with thick walls. Although I had made careful calculations I had over-dimensioned it. The new one was built with much attention to the weight. Instead of Oregon Pine I this time choose American Sproos, which is about 20 % lighter, but still with about the same strength. I also made it much thinner in the walls, still, however, with almost the same outer dimensions. The outer surface of the mast was covered with transparent glass fibre reinforced epoxy. After having changed the mast I ended up with a boat that had a 25 per cent higher stability."

                - text: "When I launched the boat the first time, it was supplied with a feathering three-bladed propeller, which worked well, still with a very low resistance, when sailing. However, after two weeks sailing the first summer, I lost the propeller. Evidently I hadnӴ mounted it properly. I had bought this propeller second hand for a fairly low price. A new one would have meant about 1500 pounds at that time, which was more than my strained economy could cope with. Thus I bought a more cheap, fixed propeller, again a three-bladed one. This worked well, when using the engine. However, when sailing it was disastrous. The resistance it caused was incredible, especially at light winds. I had to sail with this ԢrakeԠfor about four-five years. In 2000 I got the opportunity to test a new three bladed folding propeller, developed by Volvo Penta. The blades, on this propeller design, are highly skewed, with a lot of weight close to the propeller tips, making it unfolding properly even when going astern. The resistance when sailing is equally low as for a feathering one. Changing the propeller made the boat go a half to one knot faster. My self-consciousness as a yacht designer was substantially increased after this."
                - text: "Due to its very v-shaped bow the boat is comfortable in head waves, although this means that in a following seaway, the boat is very vivid and the rudder has to be used. As a matter of fact, on order to compensate for this, I lengthened the rudder and put on a skeg between the keel and the rudder after a couple of years."
                - text: "In upwind she is very steady and the weather helm is just as is it should be, with 3-6 degrees rudder angle in normal wind conditions. She is still somewhat tender and has to be reefed at about 15 knots wind (when sailing upwind). A typical upwind speed is, say, 6.4-6.5 knots, and the maximum speed in open winds approximately 8.0-8.2 knots."
